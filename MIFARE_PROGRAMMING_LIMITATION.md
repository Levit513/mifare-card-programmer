# MIFARE Classic Programming Limitation

## Issue Identified
The Web NFC API **cannot write raw MIFARE Classic sector data**. It only supports NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) messages, not low-level block programming.

## Why Programming Fails
- Web NFC API is designed for high-level NDEF messages
- MIFARE Classic requires low-level sector/block access
- Browser security restrictions prevent raw card programming
- Cards may not support NDEF writing at all

## Current System Behavior
- Creates NDEF messages with MIFARE data as text
- Writes reference data to card (not actual sector programming)
- Cannot modify actual MIFARE Classic sectors/blocks
- Programming "succeeds" but doesn't write intended data

## Solutions for True MIFARE Programming

### Option 1: Native Mobile App
- Use Android NFC APIs directly (not Web NFC)
- Requires native app development
- Can access low-level MIFARE functions
- Full sector/block programming capability

### Option 2: Specialized Hardware
- Use dedicated MIFARE programmers (Proxmark3, etc.)
- Connect via USB/serial to computer
- Full control over card programming
- Professional-grade solution

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Web interface for program creation/management
- Native companion app for actual programming
- QR codes to transfer programming data
- Best of both worlds

## Recommendation
For true MIFARE Classic programming, you need:
1. **Native Android app** with NFC permissions
2. **Specialized hardware** like Proxmark3
3. **Desktop software** with card reader support

The current web-based system can manage programs and generate programming instructions, but cannot perform actual MIFARE Classic sector programming due to browser/API limitations.
