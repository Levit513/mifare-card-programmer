# üîç Systematic APK Download Debug Plan

## Problem Statement
- Mobile redirect shows "Download RF Access APK" button
- Button leads to 404 error
- Need to isolate the exact failure point

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Verify GitHub Release Structure
- [ ] Check what tag was actually created (v1.0.0 vs v1.0.0.0)
- [ ] Verify APK file was uploaded to release
- [ ] Check exact filename of uploaded APK

### Step 2: Test Direct URLs
- [ ] Test: https://github.com/Levit513/RF-Access/releases/tag/v1.0.0
- [ ] Test: https://github.com/Levit513/RF-Access/releases/tag/v1.0.0.0
- [ ] Test actual download URLs with correct tag/filename

### Step 3: Check Mobile Redirect Code
- [ ] Verify current download URL in mobile_redirect.html
- [ ] Test mobile redirect page directly
- [ ] Check if Railway deployment has latest changes

### Step 4: Manual Verification
- [ ] Download APK manually from GitHub
- [ ] Test exact download URL format
- [ ] Update mobile redirect with working URL

## Current Findings
- Release exists at tag `v1.0.0.0` (not `v1.0.0`)
- Mobile redirect points to wrong tag: `/download/v1.0.0/`
- Should point to: `/download/v1.0.0.0/`

## Next Action
Fix the tag mismatch in mobile_redirect.html
